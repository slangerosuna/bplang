this is a docstring
it can span multiple lines and is used for documentation

docstrings use the same syntax as string literals (meaning that you can also use one double quotation mark instead of 3),
and even evaluate to a string literal. the only difference is that it is typically not assigned to a variable and they are parsed
by the documentation generator

# How are docstrings formatted?
markdown is used to format docstrings

docstrings are not required to be at the top of a file, before a function, before a type, or before a variable, but it is recommended

# you can import C++ libraries like this:
# import extern CPP <map>; #it's gonna be a while before I get this working, though

# use namespace std; # allows you to use the std namespace without having to type std:: every time

# you can also import C libraries like this:
# import extern C <stdio.h>;

# finally, you can import other bp files like this:
# mod other_file; # this will import either ./other_file.bp or ./other_file/mod.bp (similar to how rust does it)

# after importing a file, you can use it like this:
# use other_file::other_func; # this will allow you to use other_func without having to type other_file::other_func every time

# you can also import all of the functions, types, and global variables from a file like this:
# use other_file::*; # this will import all of the functions, types, and global variables from other_file
# this is not recommended as it can cause name collisions and makes it harder to tell where a function is coming from
# but it can be useful when you are importing a lot of functions from a file or are just making a quick script and don't care about name collisions

# if you want to import a file, but it is in a different directory, you can do this:
# `mod other_file: "./other_dir/other_file.bp";`
# this is considered bad practice as it can result in the same file being imported multiple times, but it is there if you want it
#
# or, if you have already imported in with `mod` in another file, you can do this:
# `use proj::other_file::other_func;`
#
# this is designed to be similar to how rust does it with `crate::other_file::other_func`

@summary: this struct is used to represent a rigid body in 3d space

# there are two forms of enums: integer enums & union enums
# integer enums look like this:
enum IntEnum: u8 {
	A, B, C, D,
}
# here, you can see that this enum is represented as a u8. All of the possible values will just be integers
# ie: IntEnum::A == 0u8 and IntEnum::D == 3u8

# union enums, on the other hand, work differently
# here's what they look like
enum UnionEnum {
	A: f32,
	B: i32,
	C: u8,
}
# here, the type becomes equivalent in memory to struct { union { f32, i32, u8 }, u8 } where it can be of any type inside the enum discriminated by the u8, which is called the discriminator

# you can have code outside of a function, which will run before the main function in the main file
# or on import if it is in a different file
# generally speaking, this should be used exclusively for global variables and constants
# but if you really want to, you can put any code here
#
# again, I would like to stress that this is generally considered bad practice and should be avoided
# but it is there if you want it
#
# for an example you can do this:
" let foo = comp |4, 4|: ![f32; 4, 4] {
	fn execute(i: u32, j: u32) {
		(i * j) as f32 # generates a 4x4 matrix with the value of i * j at each index (i and j are within the range 0..4, not 1..5)
	}
}; "
# which does everything from loading and compiling the generated file, to making heap allocations outside of a function
# an important thing to note is that, if you configure your gpu in the main function, this will run prior to that and very well may crash your program
# because of this, if you decide to do this for some reason, you should configure your gpu at the top of the file (before the rest of the global code)
#
# also, you should absolutely never configure your gpu in the global code of any file other than the main file to avoid configuration conflicts
# if you want to configure your gpu in a different file, you should do it in a function and call that function from the main file
# and if you are making a library, you should only ever allow the user to configure the gpu through a function call to a
# function that explicitly mentions that it configures the gpu in at least the docstring, if not the name of the function itself
#
# ie: if you do have a function that configures the gpu, it should be called something like this:
"
@summary: configures the gpu
"
fn configure_gpu() {
	# code to configure the gpu
}

	};
	# here type inference is used to determine the type of rb, but the type inference here can be overridden with a type annotation
	# ie: var rb: [f32;22]* = alloc RigidBody { ... };
	# this is because alloc evaluates to a ()* (a pointer to a void type), so the type of rb is gotten from a "soft inference" of the type, essentially an educated guess where other types may still be valid
	# this is done to make the language more user-friendly and to make it easier to write code
	# if you want to, you can also do this:
	# var rb: RigidBody* = alloc RigidBody { ... };
	# this is the same as the previous line, but it is more explicit
	# you can also do this:
	# var rb: &RigidBody = try alloc RigidBody { ... };
	# in bp, references are just pointers with restrictions enforced by the compiler, so, since alloc returns a pointer, you can try cast it to a reference
	# if the pointer is null, the cast will fail and the try will return an error type
	# this can be useful if you want to make sure that the pointer is not null before you use it
	# here, null exists only for pointers, and is equivalent to nullptr in C++
	# this is equivalent to:
	# var rb = try where rb = alloc RigidBody { ... } { if rb != null { Ok(rb as &RigidBody) } else { Err(()) }};
	# this is more verbose, but better explains what is happening

	# here, the `where` keyword is used to create a new scope where the variable rb is defined, allowing for the use of the if statement in the expression
	# this is done for those good ol' functional programming vibes
	# this is equivalent to:
	# var RB = alloc RigidBody { ... };
	#
	# var rb: ?&RigidBody;
	# if RB != null {
	# 	rb = Some(RB as &RigidBody);
	# } else {
	# 	rb = None;
	# }
	# var rb = try rb;

	# even better, you can do this:
	# var rb: ?&RigidBody = alloc RigidBody { ... };
	# in this case, you get an optional reference, which is a reference that may or may not be None, and converting it to a regular reference is done with the try syntax
	# on top of this, unlike with a regular reference, the cast, instead of being done at runtime, is done at compile time, so, instead of branching, the cast is just a no-op
	# the same can be done if you want an error type instead of an optional type
	# var rb: !&RigidBody = alloc RigidBody { ... };
	# here the only difference is that you are more explicitly stating that a failure to allocate the memory is an error
	# but, under the hood, !&RigidBody has the same representation as ?&RigidBody

	# you can also accept memory errors like this:
	# var rb: MemoryError!&RigidBody = alloc RigidBody { ... };
	# here, the type of rb is a result type with a memory error as the error type and a reference to a RigidBody as the ok type
	# this is useful if you want to know how the memory allocation failed if it did

	# even though rb is a pointer, you can still access its fields with the . operator, the compiler will automatically dereference it
	# though you can also use the -> operator if you want to a pointer to a field of a struct
	# ie: *(rb->pos) == rb.pos == (*rb).pos
	defer free rb; #frees rb at end of scope

	# if you don't want to have the struct on the stack ever, you can do this:
	# var rb = alloc RigidBody;
	# rb.pos = |0, 0, 0|;
	# rb.rot = |0, 0, 0|; ...
	# or
	# var rb: RigidBody* = alloc [f32; 22]; #allocs a 22 element array of f32s and casts it to a RigidBody
	# or even
	# var rb: RigidBody* = alloc 704 as usize; #allocs 704 bytes and casts it to a RigidBody
	# it just allocs the memory of that size and returns a pointer to the start of it, so it's up to you to make sure that the memory is used correctly
	# if the compiler catches you doing something wrong, it will give you a warning, but it won't stop you from doing it
	# this can also be done with arrays and other types
	# you can even do this:
	# var rb: RigidBody* = alloc 1000 as usize;
	# here, rb is a pointer to 1000 bytes of memory, but its first 704 bytes is still a RigidBody

	# if you really want to, you can do this:
	# var rb: RigidBody = alloc 500 as usize;
	# but this will cause a segfault if you try to access any of the fields of rb past the 500th byte

	# creates a compute shader, compiles it, and loads it onto the gpu
	# every shader either has a return type of ![some type, n] or [!some type; n]
	# the former is a result wrapped around buffer of n elements of type some type
	# the latter is a buffer of n elements of of a result wrapped around some type type

	# under the hood, the shader is converted to WGSL and then is JITC
	# this is done for wasm compatibility and to allow for easy cross-compilation

	# it's possible that I will change this to use SPIR-V instead of WGSL, but I'm not sure yet
	# This would allow for better performance, but would be at the cost of wasm compatibility

	# syntax for shader declaration:
	# let [shader_name] = [shader_type] |[size]|: ![output type; [size]]
	# ie:
	let one_plus_one = comp |1|: ![f32; 1] {
		uni foo: [f32; 4, 4]; # uniform variables can be passed in as parameters
		buf bar: [f32; 100]; # buffer variables can be passed in as parameters as well

		fn execute(i: u32) { # i, j, and k all refer to indices in dispatching
			var val = 1 + 1; # val is inferred to be a u32
			val #fills the index of the return array with the returned value of this function
			    #this can only be done if the return type of the shader is of the same size as the shader
			    #if the return type is of a different size, you have to index into it like this: ret[i] = val
			    #shaders can call any const function regardless of whether or not it's defined within a shader
			    #this is because the compiler will duplicate the function into the shader
			    #it can only call const functions because other functions may require heap allocations or access cpu-only data
			    #this is done so that the shader can be run on the gpu
			    #this means that many shaders can use libraries that were written for the cpu without any modification
			    #this is done to make the language more user-friendly and to make it easier to write code

# other useful features of this language that weren't included earlier are:
# Good anonymous types:
# There are many ways of creating types in this language, some were shown
# Not all types are named, though
#
# Some examples of anonymous types include
# Tuples: the syntax for tuple types is `(T, Other, ...)`, here, any number of types can be combined without names
# To access the elements of a tuple, you just do `tuple.[element index]`, ie, to access the T element on `(T, Q, R)`, you would do `tuple.0`
# These types are discriminated based off of only the order of types that make it up, so any (f32, f32) will be of the same type as any other
#
# tuples of the same type, ie. (f32, f32) are equivalent in memory to a slice of the elements, in this case, [f32; 2], and, because of this, you can cast between them at no cost
#
# another types which can be no-cost casted to and from a tuple is the\

# header files are not human written in this language as the compiler will automatically generate them
# this is done by parsing the source code and generating a header file with all public declarations
# the header file also contains the docstrings of all public declarations with them which can be used by IDEs
#
# the format of the header file is as follows:
#
# """
# docstring
# """
# fn [name]([param name]: [param type], ...): [return type]; @[address of function]
#
# the header file is generated in the same directory as the source file with the same name as the source file except with a .bph extension; ie: main.bph
# the header file is generated every time the source file is compiled along with the object file with a .bpo extension; ie: main.bpo
#
# the final step of compilation is to link all the object files together into a single executable
#
# to do all of this with a single command, you can run the following command:
# `bp build` or equivalently `bp b`
# if you want to run the executable after it is built, you can run the following command:
# `bp run` or equivalently `bp r`
#
# running the following command will generate documentation for a library written in this language:
# `bp gendocsite -h path/to/project/dir/with/generated/headers -o path/to/output/dir -n [name of library]`
# this generates a simple page website with all the docstrings of all public declarations in the format of a series of html files
# this site also contains a search bar which can be used to search for a specific declaration by name
#
# this is done in order to make the language more accessible to new users and to give a standard method of making good documentation for libraries written in this language
#
# beyond this, the bp cli will have a standard build system and package manager inspired by cargo
#
# to publish a library, you can run the following command:
# `bp publish -a [address of the git repository] -n [name of library] -v [version number]`
#
# to add a library to your project, you can run the following command:
# `bp add -n [name of library] -v [version number]`
# here, version number is optional and if not specified, the latest version will be added
# this will add the library to the project directory and add it to the list of dependencies in the bp.toml file
